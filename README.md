## ✨ Hey there! I'm Ashley. ✨ 
  </div>
  
- 🥘 I have a hunger to learn more, and always eat more, too.  
- 📖 I’m currently learning everything there is to know in Ruby on Rails. 

In my limited free time, you can find me:
- 👩‍🍳 Cooking
- 🚲 Exercising
- 🐶 🐱 Hanging with a lot of animals
- ☕️ Drinking far too much coffee
